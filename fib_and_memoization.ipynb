    "3. **Recursive Calculation**: If the value is not in the memo dictionary, compute it using the recursive relation `fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.\n",

    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Base Cases**: Directly return 0 for `n = 0` and 1 for `n = 1`.\n",

    "3. **Iteration**: Use a loop to iteratively compute the next Fibonacci number by updating a and b. For each iteration, set a to b and b to a + b.\n",
